## <a name='opsfile'></a>Using an ops-file with bbl

### About ops-files

Certain features of BOSH, particularly experimental features or tuning parameters, must be enabled by modifying your
Director's deployment manifest. `bosh-deployment` contains many such ops files for common features and options.

### Using the pre-made operations files
You can provide any number of ops files or variables to `bosh create-env` by editing .This file will not be overridden by bbl unless `bbl plan` is
called. If you modify this file, be sure to check your modifications in to git before running `bbl plan` again so that
you may resolve conflicts if they arise.

In this example, I use a local version of BOSH director that I have built based off of a branch:
```diff
#!/bin/sh
bosh create-env \
  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
  --state  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/vars/bosh-state.json \
  --vars-store  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/vars/director-variables.yml \
  --vars-file  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/vars/director-deployment-vars.yml \
+  -o ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/local-bosh-release.yml
+  -v local_bosh_release=${BBL_STATE_DIR}/../../build/bosh-dev.tgz
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/cpi.yml \
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/jumpbox-user.yml \
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/uaa.yml \
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/../shared/bosh-deployment/credhub.yml 
```

### Authoring an ops-file
The operations files provided by `bosh-deployment` may not meet your needs. In this case you will have to write your own
custom ops-file. Store it somewhere outside of the bosh-deployment directory. New versions of bbl will keep the
bosh-deployment directory in sync with the latest configuration and releases, so modifications may be lost when
`bbl plan` is run in the future. Consider storing it in the top level of your state directory if it is environmentally
specific, or above the state directory if it is true for all environments.

Here is an example of adding an ops file that configures a few settings on all of my BOSH directors:  
```diff
#!/bin/sh
bosh create-env \
  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
  --state  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/vars/bosh-state.json \
  --vars-store  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/vars/director-variables.yml \
  --vars-file  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/vars/director-deployment-vars.yml \
+  -o ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/../../bbl-envs/shared/increase-workers-threads-and-flush-arp.yml
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/cpi.yml \  
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/cpi.yml \
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/jumpbox-user.yml \
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/bosh-deployment/uaa.yml \
  -o  ${BBL_STATE_DIR}/../shared/bosh-deployment/credhub.yml 
```
## <a name='terraform'></a>Customizing IaaS Paving with Terraform
Numerous settings can be reconfigured repeatedly by editing `$BBL_STATE_DIR/vars/terraform.tfvars` or adding a terraform override into  `$BBL_STATE_DIR/terraform/my-cool-tf-template.override`. Some settings, like VPCs, are not able to be changed after initial creation so it may be better to `bbl plan` first before running `bbl up` for the first time.

### Example: adjusting the cidr on AWS
1. Plan the environment:
    ```
    mkdir some-env && cd some-env
    echo BBL_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=MYKEY
    echo BBL_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=MYSECRET
    bbl plan --iaas aws --aws-region us-west-1
    echo -e "\nvpc_cidr=\"192.168.0.0/20\"" >> vars/terraform.tfvars
    ```
1. Create the environment:
    ```
    bbl up
    ```
    That's it. Your director is now at `192.168.0.6`.

## <a name='boshlite'></a>Deploying BOSH lite on GCP
1. Plan the environment:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader.git
    mkdir some-env && cd some-env
    BBL_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<MYSERVICEACCOUNTKEY>
    bbl plan --name some-env --iaas gcp --gcp-region us-west-1
    cp -r ../bosh-bootloader/plan-patches/bosh-lite-gcp/ .
    ```
1. Create the environment:
    ```
    bbl up
    ```
1. Determine your external IP:
    ```
    bosh int vars/director-deployment-vars.yml --path /external_ip
    ```
1. Add it to your DNS:
    ```
    bosh-lite.infrastructure.cf-app.com.	A	300	${bosh_lite_external_ip}
    *.bosh-lite.infrastructure.cf-app.com.	CNAME	300	bosh-lite.infrastructure.cf-app.com.
    ```
1. Deploy cf-deployment:
    ```
    $ bosh upload-stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3468.5
    $ bosh deploy -d cf -v 'system_domain=cf.evanfarrar.com' -o operations/bosh-lite.yml cf-deployment.yml -o operations/use-compiled-releases.yml
    ```

## <a name='isoseg'></a>Deploying an isolation segment
Placeholder: this part of the advanced guide is a work in progress.

## <a name='concourse'></a>~~Deploy concourse with bosh create-env~~ Deprecated workflow, needs updating

1. Create the network and firewall rules. **Important here is the `--no-director` flag.**

    ```
    bbl up \
      --gcp-zone <INSERT ZONE> \
      --gcp-region <INSERT REGION> \
      --gcp-service-account-key <INSERT SERVICE ACCOUNT KEY> \
      --iaas gcp \
      --no-director
    ```

1. Follow the deployment instructions in [concourse-deployment](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-deployment).
Use the network related variables supplied by `bbl bosh-deployment-vars`.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/concourse/concourse-deployment.git
    bosh create-env concourse-deployment/concourse.yml  \
      --state ~/environments/concourse/state.json  \
      -o concourse-deployment/infrastructures/gcp.yml  \
      --vars-store ~/environments/concourse/creds.yml  \
      -l <(bbl --state-dir ~/environments/concourse bosh-deployment-vars | sed 's/external_ip/public_ip/')
    ```

1. Open port `4443` on the firewall rule `concourse-bosh-open`.

1. Check out your new concourse at `https://<bbl director-address>:4443`.
