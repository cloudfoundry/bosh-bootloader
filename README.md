# bosh-bootloader
Also known as `bbl` *(pronounced: "bubble")*, bosh-bootloader is a command line utility for standing up BOSH
on an IaaS. `bbl` currently supports AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, Openstack and vSphere.

## Prerequisites

### Install Dependencies

The following should be installed on your local machine
- [bosh-cli](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html)
- [bosh create-env dependencies](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-env-deps.html)
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.11.0
- ruby (necessary for bosh create-env)

### Install bosh-bootloader using a package manager

**Mac OS X**

```sh
$ brew tap cloudfoundry/tap
$ brew install bosh-cli
$ brew install bbl
```

### Managing state

The bbl state directory contains all of the files that were used to create your
bosh director. You will need the entire bbl state in order to update, delete, or
run bosh commands against the environment, so you should keep it someone anyone
on your team can access it. However, it is important to note that the bbl state
directory contains very senstive IAAS credentials, so you should keep it
somewhere you feel comfortable storing these credentials, such as an encrypted
bucket.

 filename |  contents
------------ | -------------
``bbl-state.json`` | Environment name, and bbl version metadata
``terraform/`` | The terraform templates bbl used to pave your IaaS. See [docs/advanced-configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md#terraform) for information on modifying this. 
``vars/`` | This is where bbl will store environment specific variables. Consider storing this outside of version control.
``jumpbox-deployment/`` | The latest [jumpbox-deployment](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/jumpbox-deployment) that has been tested with your version of bbl.
``create-jumpbox.sh`` | The BOSH cli command bbl will use to create your jumpbox.
``bosh-deployment/`` | The latest [bosh-deployment](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment) that has been tested with your version of bbl
``create-director.sh`` | The BOSH cli command bbl will use to create your director when you run `bbl up`. See [docs/advanced-configuration](docs/advanced-configuration.md#opsfile) for help with modifying this.
``cloud-config/``| The cloud-config yaml that bbl will upload to the director to map IAAS resources to BOSH resources.
``delete-director.sh`` | The BOSH cli command bbl will use to delete your director.
``delete-jumpbox.sh`` | The BOSH cli command bbl will use to delete your jumpbox.

### Troubleshooting

To turn on bbl debugging traces, use `bbl --debug` flag.

To turn on [bosh debugging](https://bosh.io/docs/build-cpi/#debugging) traces, export the `BOSH_LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable in the related bbl shell script, such as `create-jumpbox.sh`. 
 
To turn on the cpi traces, override or set cpi configuration, e.g. for vsphere cpi within `jumpbox-deployment/vsphere/cpi.yml` set `http_logging: true` according to [vsphere cpi documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/vsphere-cpi/#global)  

### Tearing down an environment

Once you are done kicking the tires on CF and BOSH, clean up your environment to save IaaS costs:

1. You must first delete any deployments on BOSH. e.g. `bosh -d cf delete-deployment`

1. `bbl down` with your IaaS user/account information.

### Automating the automation tool

In order to use `bbl` in your concourse pipelines, the current supported way
for `cf-deployment` is to use the
[cf-deployment-concourse-tasks](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-concourse-tasks).

There is a work-in-progress concourse resource for bbl:
[bbl-state-resource](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bbl-state-resource).
