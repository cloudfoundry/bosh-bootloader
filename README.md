# bosh-bootloader
---

This is a command line utility for standing up a CloudFoundry or Concourse installation
on an IAAS. This CLI is currently under heavy development, and the initial goal is to
support bootstrapping a CloudFoundry installation on AWS.

## Guides

- [Getting Started on AWS](docs/getting-started-aws.md)
- [Deploying Concourse on GCP](docs/concourse.md)
- [Deploying Cloud Foundry on GCP](docs/cloudfoundry.md)
- [Advanced BOSH Configuration](docs/advanced.md)

## Prerequisites

### Install Dependencies

The following should be installed on your local machine
- BOSH v2 CLI  [BOSH v2 CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html)
- terraform >= 0.9.1 ([download here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html))

### Install bosh-bootloader

bosh-bootloader can be installed by downloading the [latest Github release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/releases/latest).

### Configure AWS

The AWS IAM user that is provided to bbl will need the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:*",
                "iam:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configure GCP

To allow bbl to set up infrastructure a service account must be provided with the
role 'roles/editor'

Example:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts create <service account name>

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create --iam-account='<service account name>@<project id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com' <service account name>.key.json

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project id> --member='user:<service account name>@<project id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com' --role='roles/editor'
```

## Usage

The `bbl` command can be invoked on the command line and will display its usage.

```
$ bbl

  delete-lbs             Deletes attached load balancer(s)
  destroy                Tears down BOSH director infrastructure
  director-address       Prints BOSH director address

  version                Prints version

  Use "bbl [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Known Issues

### Re-running `bbl up` Detaches Instances from GCP LBs

Due to `bbl`'s use of Terraform to create infrastructure on GCP, re-running
`bbl up` after deploying either CloudFoundry or Concourse will detach any
instances that were attached to a load balancer created by `bbl`. At this
time, the only known work-around is to recreate the affected instance
using `bosh recreate`.

The `bbl` team is planning to address this issue in an upcoming release.
