# bosh-bootloader
---

This is a command line utility for standing up a CloudFoundry or Concourse installation 
on an IAAS. This CLI is currently under heavy development, and the initial goal is to 
support bootstrapping a CloudFoundry installation on AWS.

## Prerequisites

### Install Dependencies

The following should be installed on your local machine
- Golang >= 1.7 (install with `brew install go`)
- bosh-init ([installation instructions](http://bosh.io/docs/install-bosh-init.html))
- terraform ([download here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html))

### Install bosh-bootloader

bosh-bootloader can be installed with go get:

```
go get github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/bbl
```

### Configure AWS

The AWS IAM user that is provided to bbl will need the following policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:*",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "elasticloadbalancing:*",
                "iam:*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Configure GCP

To allow bbl to set up infrastructure a service account must be provided with the
role 'roles/editor'

Example:
```
gcloud iam service-accounts create some-account-name
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create "service-account.key.json" --iam-account "some-account-name@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID --member 'serviceAccount:some-account-name@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com' --role 'roles/editor'
```
