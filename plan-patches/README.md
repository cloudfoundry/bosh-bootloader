## Plan Patches

**WARNING: We do not test these configurations as thoroughly as the rest of bosh-bootloader.**

Plan patches can be used to customize the IAAS
environment and bosh director that is created by
`bbl up`.

A patch is a directory with a set of files organized in the same hierarchy as the bbl-state dir.
`bbl down` won't delete files that bbl didn't create, and `bbl up` will make an effort to merge your terraform overrides and apply your jumpbox, director, and cloud-config ops files provided that they're in the right directories.

Many of these have additional prep steps or specific downstream bosh deployments in mind, so be sure to read the `README.md` of the patch you're trying to apply.
